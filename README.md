I am currently studying Math & Computer Science at **University of California - San Diego**, I am also double majoring in Cognative Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation. 

**Math & Computer Science | Cognitive Sciece with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation:**

I decided to double major because of my passion in Computer Science and how the human brain works. I am intrigued by the comparison between how the human brain computes and computer computation.
My academic journey, with a focus on Math-Computer Science, has equipped me with a robust foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. This, combined with Cognitive Science, places me at the intersection of analytical thinking, computational expertise, and an in-depth understanding of how machine learning algorithms work.
